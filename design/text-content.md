# Slack is your digital HQ

Transform the way you work with one place for everyone and everything you need to get stuff done.

# Now is your moment to build a better tomorrow

We’ve seen what the future can be. Now it’s time to decide what it will be.

# Move faster by organizing your work life

The key to productivity in Slack is organized spaces called channels—a different one for everything you’re working on. With all the people, messages and files related to a topic in one place, you can move a whole lot faster.

# Focus your time, on your own terms

Give yourself the flexibility to work when, where and how you work best. Take control of notifications, collaborate live or on your own time, and find answers in conversations from across your company.

# Simplify teamwork for everyone

Give everyone you work with—inside and outside your company—a more productive way to stay in sync. Respond faster with emoji, keep conversations focused in channels, and simplify all your communication into one place.

# Sign up

Create a new Slack workspace in just a few moments. It’s free to try for teams of any size.

# Invite your coworkers

Slack is better together (no, really, it’s a bit underwhelming by yourself), and it’s easy to invite your team.

# Try it out

Run a project, coordinate with your team, or just talk it out. Slack is a blank canvas for teamwork.
